# Web App testing
Here you can find testing documentation made during my study of Web App testing. 

I've made testing documentation for this [web app](https://demo.guru99.com/telecom/index.html):

1. Here is the [check-list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1t7zxw7MJd_TFvwMrdYNumSct2IN_6UspmAyU3ZmTw/edit?usp=sharing) for the main page. The following [requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17pDHGwkAFIrDY8UlfVdkKrw2lv6KFSYgS0cryyty1Fk/edit#gid=0) were given. 

2. You can find some test cases for the Add Customer functionality in the attached files. The test cases are made via Qase.

3. The bug reports are also in the attached files. The bug reports are made via Youtrack.


I've executed testing for [online-shop](http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/) and prepared testing documentation:

1. [Check-list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1t7zxw7MJd_TFvwMrdYNumSct2IN_6UspmAyU3ZmTw/edit?usp=sharing) for cart and payment modules.

2.  Test cases for the same modules (you can find them in atached files).

3.  Bug reports are also in the attached files.
