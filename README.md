Here is the [check-list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1t7zxw7MJd_TFvwMrdYNumSct2IN_6UspmAyU3ZmTw/edit?usp=sharing) for the main page of this [web app](https://demo.guru99.com/telecom/index.html). The following [requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17pDHGwkAFIrDY8UlfVdkKrw2lv6KFSYgS0cryyty1Fk/edit#gid=0) were given. 

I made some test cases for the Add Customer funtionality of this [web app](https://demo.guru99.com/telecom/index.html). You can find them in the attached files.
