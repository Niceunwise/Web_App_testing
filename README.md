Here you can find testing documentation made during my study of Web App testing. 

I've made testing documentation for this [web app](https://demo.guru99.com/telecom/index.html).

1. Here is the [check-list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1t7zxw7MJd_TFvwMrdYNumSct2IN_6UspmAyU3ZmTw/edit?usp=sharing) for the main page. The following [requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17pDHGwkAFIrDY8UlfVdkKrw2lv6KFSYgS0cryyty1Fk/edit#gid=0) were given. 

2. You can find some test cases for the Add Customer funtionality in the attached files. The test cases are made via Quase.

3. The bug reports are also in the attached files. The bug reports are made via Youtrack.
